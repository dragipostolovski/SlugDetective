# Slug Detective

Slug Detective adds a simple way to search posts by their slug inside the WordPress admin.  
It works in two places:

1. The main post search in the admin list view.
2. ACF Relationship fields.

This is useful when the post title differs from its slug or when slugs follow a naming pattern.

## How It Works

Use a special search pattern when searching:

| Pattern | Example | Effect |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `slug:your-slug` | `slug:product-123` | Matches posts with an exact slug. |
| `slug:your-slug:like` | `slug:product:`like | Matches posts where the slug contains the value. |

### Exact Match
slug:hello-world

### Partial Match
slug:hello:like

This will return any post where the slug contains `hello`.

## Where You Can Use It

### Post List Search
In **Posts**, **Pages**, or any custom post type:

### ACF Relationship Field
When searching inside the field:
slug:my-post


Works the same way as the admin list.

## Example Use Cases

- You use machine-friendly slugs to categorize items and want fast lookup.
- Your titles are translated but slugs stay original.
- You need to quickly locate posts generated by import tools.

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin folder to `wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin in **Plugins**.
3. No further configuration needed.

---

## Important Notes

- The search only triggers when the query starts with `slug:`.
- Everything else works as normal.
- Does not modify front-end queries.
